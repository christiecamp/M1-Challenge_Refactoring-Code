# 01 CHALLENGE - hw1_code-refractor


## User Story

**AS A** marketing agency

**I WANT** a codebase that follows accessibility standards

**SO THAT** our own site is optimized for search engines

This will be done by **refactoring** existing code&mdash;improving it without changing what it does - to meet the **Acceptance Criteria**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**GIVEN** a webpage meets accessibility standards

**WHEN** I view the source code

**THEN** I find semantic HTML elements

**WHEN** I view the structure of the HTML elements

**THEN** I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

**WHEN** I view the icon and image elements

**THEN** I find accessible alt attributes

**WHEN** I view the heading attributes

**THEN** they fall in sequential order

**WHEN** I view the title element

**THEN** I find a concise, descriptive title


## IMPORTANT NOTE

An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business&mdash;for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

Accessibility can include complex requirements, but your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria for this project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

To impress clients, you should always exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, check that all links are functioning correctly. You can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.


## Mock-Up
